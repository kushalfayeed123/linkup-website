            to log out of the system completely by allowing on-screen display of
            his/her mobile application information. The company is further
            relieved of any liability as regards breach of duty of secrecy
            arising out of customer’s inability to scrupulously observe and

            known to another person. Where a customer notifies the company of
            his intention to change his/her PIN and/or passcode arising from
            either his loss of memory of same or that it has come to notice of a
            third party, the company shall with the consent of the customer,

            responsible for any loss(es) that occurs between the period of such
            memory of the PIN and/or password or knowledge of a third party and
            the time the report is lodged with the Company. The Customer shall
            be responsible for any fraud, loss and/or liability to the Company
            or third party arising from usage of the customer’s PIN and/or
            password being used by a third party The Customer shall be
